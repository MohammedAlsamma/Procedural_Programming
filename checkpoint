Two non-zero vectors are orthogonal or perpendicular if their dot product is zero.

In other words,if two non-zero vectors are not orthogonal or perpendicular then their dot product is not equal to zero.

From the question v1 and v2 are non-zero vectors and their dot product is not equal to zero.

This tells us that, the two vectors are not perpendicular.

The correct choice is A.
